# DarkRai JavaScript Online Compiler
Welcome to the **DarkRai JavaScript Online Compiler**! This project is a simple yet powerful online tool designed for writing, editing, and running JavaScript code directly in your browser.

## Behind the Project

As a developer, I found myself frequently switching between the console and VS Code while working on JavaScript projects. This constant back-and-forth was not only tedious but also disrupted my workflow. Additionally, existing online JavaScript compilers did not meet my needs or preferences.

Determined to streamline my development process and avoid the limitations of other tools, I decided to build my own online JavaScript compiler. This project aims to provide a clean, user-friendly environment where you can write, test, and run JavaScript code seamlessly without needing to switch between different tools or platforms.

## Features

- **Code Editor**: A built-in editor that allows you to write and modify JavaScript code with an intuitive and simple interface.
- **Run Code**: Execute your JavaScript code and see the output directly on the page.
- **Console Output**: View `console.log` outputs and errors in real-time in a dedicated output area.
- **GitHub Integration**: Access resources or support via the GitHub button integrated into the interface.
